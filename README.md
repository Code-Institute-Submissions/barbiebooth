As a response to an - almost traumatic - event in which my mother lost her very first Barbie Doll (it was actually the very first doll that was given away to the crowd during a huge Barbie launch event in Amsterdam, 1961), she started collecting all Barbie Dolls that were released between 1961 and 1980.</br>
After years of diligent tracing at collector’s events and markets, her collection was almost complete. She has collected hundreds of authentic Barbie dolls, Skippers, and Kens. All mended, and with their original clothing and outfits. Aside from that, she has a massive collection of clothing and accessories for the dolls.</br>
But after years of enjoying the collection, she feels it’s time to let it go. It’s also an emotional process, so why not do it step by step, in her own online store. I promised her once that if I would be able to, I would build the online store for her. So here I am taking the first step.</br>
