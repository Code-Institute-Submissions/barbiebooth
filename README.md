As a response to an - almost traumatic - event in which my mother lost her very first Barbie Doll (it was actually the very first doll that was given away to the crowd during a huge Barbie launch event in Amsterdam, 1961), she started collecting all Barbie Dolls that were released between 1961 and 1980.</br></br>
After years of diligent tracing at collector’s events and markets, her collection was almost complete. She has collected hundreds of authentic Barbie dolls, Skippers, and Kens. All mended, and with their original clothing and outfits. Aside from that, she has a massive collection of clothing and accessories for the dolls.</br></br>
But after years of enjoying the collection, she feels it’s time to let it go. It’s also an emotional process, so why not do it step by step, in her own online store. I promised her once that if I would be able to, I would build the online store for her. So here I am taking the first step.</br></br>
The community of Barbie collectors is huge and this store needs to be a popular point for Barbie collectors all over the world. That is why every product needs a detailed description, with the original title of the Barbie/accessory along with its release year, and state of condition.</br></br>
Some dolls are extremely rare and expensive. Finding an exact copy of it will be hard. Since it is her collection she is selling, all dolls are unique, so the buyer won’t be able to change the quantity of a product. Once a product has been bought, it is marked as ‘sold’ in the database.</br></br>

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

Barbie Booth utilises a colour scheme of 8 different colours. Pink and yellow colours are the mainly used colours. The pink colours are used because, of course, these are the colours of the Barbie brand. To complement this colour, mint and yellow are used. This gives the website a playful, seventies style feeling.

#### Typography

<div align="center">

</div>

- The primary font used for Barbie Booth is called ‘Ubuntu’ and it is used in the body of all pages. The font is used because it is recognized for its easy readability, and because it has small curves, it matches the seventies feeling of the website.
- The secondary font used for Barbie Booth is called ‘Dollie Script’. It is used in the logo and most of the headers on the website. This font is chosen because it shows strong similarities with the original Barbie logo and is therefore recognizable for visitors of the website. Dollie Script has a strong seventies feeling to it, which adds to the overall feeling of the website. The logo utilizes Dollie Script with a white colour and black shadow (outlines). All headers use Dollie Script with a purple colour and every first letter of every word capitalized.

#### Imagery

- Much time has been spent on the imagery of the website. The main goal was to give the website a seventies style feeling, as it matches time period of the products on the website. Therefore, a lot of seventies style organic figures were used.
- The header of the home page uses a pink and yellow spiral which goal it is to emphasize the Barbies that slide in- and out on the left side of the page. It creates a quirky seventies style ‘showcase’ of the products on the website.
- To give the website continuity in its imagery, the spiral returns on other pages of the website as well, albeit with a much softer colour scheme so it does not distract from the content of the page.
- The spiral returns once again on the ‘Processing Transaction’ overlay when a visitor checks out. This time, the spiral image has four different versions that are part of an animation consisting of four frames. The strings of the spiral are divided into four colours of the colour scheme and with every frame each string colour jumps to the string next to it. When animated, it creates a spinning effect and adds to the impression that background processes are running.
- The main, informative section of the homepage uses a mainly light pink coloured background to distinct it from the header above it. If you look closely, you can see some stylized Barbie legs in light yellow. In the middle there’s a big, mint coloured ‘B’ in the middle of this background. It is hard to style this image as it should not be too noisy, but using a plain colour would make it too boring and would not add to a seventies feeling of the website.
- For the product images, pictures of the dolls, clothing and accessories were manually taken using a photo studio lightbox. This way, all products are lighted equally and this adds to the continuity of the imagery on the products page. The pictures are taken with a white background and plain white light, which gives a clean feeling to them.
