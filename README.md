As a response to an - almost traumatic - event in which my mother lost her very first Barbie Doll (it was actually the very first doll that was given away to the crowd during a huge Barbie launch event in Amsterdam, 1961), she started collecting all Barbie Dolls that were released between 1961 and 1980.</br></br>
After years of diligent tracing at collector’s events and markets, her collection was almost complete. She has collected hundreds of authentic Barbie dolls, Skippers, and Kens. All mended, and with their original clothing and outfits. Aside from that, she has a massive collection of clothing and accessories for the dolls.</br></br>
But after years of enjoying the collection, she feels it’s time to let it go. It’s also an emotional process, so why not do it step by step, in her own online store. I promised her once that if I would be able to, I would build the online store for her. So here I am taking the first step.</br></br>
The community of Barbie collectors is huge and this store needs to be a popular point for Barbie collectors all over the world. That is why every product needs a detailed description, with the original title of the Barbie/accessory along with its release year, and state of condition.</br></br>
Some dolls are extremely rare and expensive. Finding an exact copy of it will be hard. Since it is her collection she is selling, all dolls are unique, so the buyer won’t be able to change the quantity of a product. Once a product has been bought, it is marked as ‘sold’ in the database.</br></br>

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

Barbie Booth utilises a colour scheme of 8 different colours. Pink and yellow colours are the mainly used colours. The pink colours are used because, of course, these are the colours of the Barbie brand. To complement this colour, mint and yellow are used. This gives the website a playful, seventies style feeling.
